### About me <br>

I'm a final year Masters student at Centrale Nantes studying Advanced Robotics. I am also a visiting student researcher at ETH Zurich at the [CRL Lab](https://crl.ethz.ch/index.html). On the side, I work as a research assistant at the [IAS Lab](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Main/LandingPage?from=Main.HomePage) run by Prof. [Jan Peters](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/JanPeters) at TU Darmstadt and at [Lab-V2](https://labs.engineering.asu.edu/labv2/) run by Dr. [Paulo Shakarian](https://labs.engineering.asu.edu/labv2/about-paulo-shakarian/) at Arizona State University. Previously I have worked as a researcher at [ARLIS](https://www.arlis.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland and interned in Dr. [Min Xu's](https://cbd.cmu.edu/people/xu.html) Lab at Carnegie Mellon University. I was very fortunate to be one of the early members of [Telekinesis](https://telekinesis.ai/), a robotics and AI startup based at TU Darmstadt. I graduated from the Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education with a B.Sc. in Computer Science, Math and Physics.

### Research
My research is based on the intersection of robotics, reinforcement learning, and embodied intelligenceâ€”where robots learn to interact and adapt within the physical world. I am passionate about developing systems capable of intelligent decision-making and adaptability in dynamic, long-horizon tasks, pushing the boundaries of what robots can achieve in real-world scenarios.

Recently I have been working with robust localization and navigation of legged robots, and policy learning in contact rich scenarios using differentiable simulation.
