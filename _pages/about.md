### About me <br>

I'm a Masters student at Centrale Nantes studying Advanced Robotics. I work as a research assistant at [Lab-V2](https://labs.engineering.asu.edu/labv2/) run by Dr. [Paulo Shakarian](https://labs.engineering.asu.edu/labv2/about-paulo-shakarian/) at Arizona State University and at [ARLIS](https://www.arlis.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland. Previously I interned in Dr. [Min Xu's](https://cbd.cmu.edu/people/xu.html) Lab at Carnegie Mellon University. I was very fortunate to be one of the early members of [Telekinesis](https://telekinesis.ai/), a robotics and AI startup based at TU Darmstadt. I graduated from the Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education with a B.Sc. in Computer Science, Math and Physics.

### Research Interests
I'm passionate about designing safe, robust and reliable Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms to make intelligent robots more widespread in use. To this end I'm excited by the possibility that combining the fields of symbolic logic and RL can create explainable systems that are more powerful than the sum of their parts.
