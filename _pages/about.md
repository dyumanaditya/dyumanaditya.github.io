### About me <br>

I'm a final year Masters student at Centrale Nantes studying Advanced Robotics. I am also a visiting student researcher at ETH Zurich at the [CRL Lab](https://crl.ethz.ch/index.html). On the side, I work as a research assistant at the [IAS Lab](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Main/LandingPage?from=Main.HomePage) run by Prof. [Jan Peters](https://www.ias.informatik.tu-darmstadt.de/Team/JanPeters) at TU Darmstadt and at [Leibniz Lab](https://leibniz.syracuse.edu/) run by Dr. [Paulo Shakarian](https://ecs.syracuse.edu/faculty-staff/paulo-shakarian) at Syracuse University. Previously I have worked as a researcher at [ARLIS](https://www.arlis.umd.edu/) at the University of Maryland and interned in Dr. [Min Xu's](https://cbd.cmu.edu/people/xu.html) Lab at Carnegie Mellon University. I was very fortunate to be one of the early members of [Telekinesis](https://telekinesis.ai/), a startup aimed at providing a no-code robot programming solution, based out of TU Darmstadt. I graduated from the Sri Aurobindo International Centre of Education with a B.Sc. in Computer Science, Math and Physics.

### Research
My research is based on the intersection of robotics and robot learning - advancing embodied intelligence in complex dynamic tasks and pushing the boundaries of what robots can achieve in real-world scenarios. I am particulary interested in bridging the gap between model-based and model-free learning through differentiable simulation in contact rich, long horizon robotic tasks.

On the side I work on neurosymbolic AI - where I try combine the fields of logic and learning to produce explainable systems, more powerful than the sum of their parts.
